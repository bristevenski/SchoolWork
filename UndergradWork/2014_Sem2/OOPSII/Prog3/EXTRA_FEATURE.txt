Program 3 - Extra Features
Brianna Muleski

1.	Random (x, y): Before pressing the “Add Bot” button, if you press the “Random” button 
				   a set of (x, y) coordinates will be generated and displayed. This button
				   also disables the use of the numericUpDown options for the coordinates until 
				   the bot is added.

2.	Random bot: Before pressing the “Add Bot” button, if no bot type is chosen from the dropdown menu, 
                then a bot type is randomly generated.


3.	Bot sound: A sound clip plays when a bot is added to the panel corresponding to the type of bot chosen/generated.

4.	Battle Info: While the application is running, the “battle info” is kept up-to-date in a text box. This 
				 textbox indicates the number of battles played, and the number of bots that have died from battles.


5.	Mute button: When clicked, the bot sound will no longer play when the bot is added to the panel. The 
				 button then changes to “unmute”, and the sound can be unmuted if clicked again.
